	<h4>What are the approches to online learning</h4>
	<p>
	  Considering the challenging socioeconomic factors, personal
	  barriers of individual teachers, political climate changes
	  and cultural forces that affect traditional classroom-based
	  education, the simplicity and ease of access to online
	  learning outside of the traditional model comes across as
	  profound. Just as I discovered the online options to enhance
	  my understanding of computer science junior year, students
	  like Ryan Orbuch and Michael Hansen, recently featured in a
	  NY Times article, are finding ways to develop usable skills
	  online. Orbuch and Hansen, high school seniors, created an
	  app using skills learned online, then marketed the product
	  and it became a bestseller. Sometimes working on the app
	  instead of schoolwork, "they were at it hours every day
	  refining the design, with Michael writing thousands of lines
	  of code using Objective-C, a computer language that he
	  learned from online tutorials" (Richtell, 3). Their app
	  earned them thirty thousand dollars in the first year since
	  its launch (Richtell, 4). These teen's success demonstrates
	  the ability of online learning to enhance and enrich
	  education beyond what a traditional classroom could and
	  would have taught.

	  Salman Khan discovered the possibility for technology enhancing
	  education almost by accident when creating YouTube tutorials to help
	  his niece in Algebra. His journey slowly unleashed his passion for
	  teaching and revealed the opportunity for him to reach millions of
	  students through the power of the Internet. Compelled by his student's
	  academic struggles and inspired by their successes, he soon became an
	  internationally known ambassador for online learning and eventually
	  education reform. The originating premise of his website was to
	  provide lessons that students can access online and watch at their own
	  pace to augment classroom learning. His lessons, now numbering over
	  four thousand, are short videos covering a specific concept, but now
	  have grown from his niece's algebra to include multiple subject areas
	  ("2014 State of the Valley"). Khan's transformative website began
	  humbly but is now seen as a force for change in education.
	</p>
	<p>
	While Salman Khan is focused on enhancing early education, Anant
	Agarwal, founder of edX, has set his sights on higher
	learning. Speaking at a TED symposium, he describes his
	desire to "reimagine education" through MOOCs - Massive Open
	Online Courses available to "students all over the world, in
	the millions, for free. Anyone who has an Internet
	connection and the will to learn can access these great
	courses from excellent universities" (Agarwal, 2013). His
	company edX is a MOOC provider that assembles and organizes
	access to available courses, provides online activities to
	enhance knowledge of the subject matter and, in some cases,
	provides credentials for students who successfully complete
	a course. Agarwal sees the opportunity to take education,
	which has been "calcified for five hundred years," from
	"oxcarts to airplanes" through the use of online resources
	(Agarwal, 2103). Perusing the edX website, students can
	enroll in subjects as diverse as "The Art of Poetry" from
	Boston University to "Autonomous Navigation for Flying
	Robots" from Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen  in Germany (edX
	How it works). Clearly educational opportunity is being
	drastically changed in its availability and application
	through these online resources.
        </p>
	<p>
	  There are other foundations similar to Khan Academy
	  and edX, which create, consolidate and organize
	  learning tools. Currently, any student struggling with
	  a concept can Google search for example, "finding the
	  lowest common denominator" and find additional
	  resources on YouTube and beyond. This is the way Bill
	  Gates, while helping his own kids with homework,
	  happened upon Salman Khan's videos and eventually
	  forged a partnership. The availability, accessibility,
	  and universality of online learning resources expands
	  daily.
