	<h4>What is the opposition to this?</h4>
	<p>
	  Considering the fact that our world is adopting new
	  technologies at an ever-rapid rate, it would seem that our
	  education system would be open to their use in the
	  classroom. Unfortunately this is not always the
	  case. Presenting at an education forum at Massachusetts
	  Institute of Technology in 2013, educational innovator Hayal
	  Koksal, PhD stated, "Without doubt, instructional technology
	  and its potential to improve instruction have progressed
	  more rapidly than acceptance and utilization in the
	  classroom" (Koksal, 2). Dr. Koksal spoke of a long history
	  of teacher opposition to new technologies when he quoted
	  another educational innovator W.F. Van Wyck who, speaking at
	  a similar forum in 1976, stated, "The largest single factor
	  affecting adoption is teacher resistance" (Koksal, 2). Some
	  of the resistance sounds noble; teachers do not want to lose
	  the human touch and give their students over to computer
	  screens and video lessons. But much of the resistance is
	  more systemic, involving cultural issues within individual
	  schools and administrations. In a study done at two
	  universities and reported in the journal Issues in
	  Education, the author summarized resistance discovered when
	  new technology was introduced to faculty. The researchers
	  identified four barriers to teacher's adoption of the new
	  technology. The first two are roadblocks educators
	  themselves should be familiar with: lack of interest and
	  lack of motivation on the part of the teachers after the new
	  technology was presented. The final two are more deeply
	  challenging; the author reports, "Third, and something
	  familiar to all organizations, implementing change is a
	  common psychoanalytic conundrum, which represents a mix of
	  personalities and quirky behaviors. Finally, recognizing the
	  existence of a condition that is far from equilibrium, which
	  state is inherent in a dynamic environment like academia"
	  (Moerschell). Educational institutions of all sizes become
	  mini-communities with cultures all their own, where the
	  individuals seem to cling to the status quo. Convincing
	  teachers to adopt a new technology presents several
	  challenges, which include, " infrastructure, expert
	  knowledge, training, long-term vision, cost-benefit
	  equations, and sufficient utilization to sustain the change"
	  (Moerschell). At Clintondale, not all the teachers were
	  enthusiastic about the new system that required them to put
	  their lessons in video form. As one teacher described his
	  reticence, "I was intimidated by another math instructor's
	  video being seen by my students, but then I found that
	  material presented from a different perspective is quite
	  beneficial to them" (Frenkel). Overcoming both
	  administrative and teacher resistance to embracing new
	  technology is clearly a big challenge to educational reform.

	</p>

	  Adding to the complexity is the fact that the expectations
	  for American teachers are at the mercy of ever-changing
	  political whims. In recent history, the No Child Left Behind
	  Act mandated standardized testing for students with
	  potentially dire consequences for teachers who failed to
	  achieve standards; but there were also reforms in response
	  to international events such as World Wars and the Russian
	  launch of Sputnik (Horn). The constantly changing pressures
	  on educators have left some weary of change itself, and
	  "they view educational reform as a phenomenon characterized
	  by one-shot, quick-fix, and faddish solutions that are here
	  today and gone tomorrow" (Horn, 259). These frustrations
	  have led technology-adopting education reformers to come up
	  with strategies for introducing change. Tom Haymes, a
	  Director of Technology and Instructional Computing at small
	  college proposes that new technologies must fulfill the
	  "three E's" to be adopted; they must be evident, easy to use
	  and essential. (Haymes, 67-68) Teachers, he argues, must
	  embrace technology for the same reasons the rest of the
	  public does, because technology eases burdens and enriches
	  life experience in user-friendly way.
