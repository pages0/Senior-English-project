	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<p>
	  I became intrigued with the idea and promise of web-based
	  learning when I was a junior in AP computer science. This
	  class, above any other, taught me the value of exploring
	  beyond the classroom as I sought out online tutorials to
	  help work through projects. I was able to find resources to
	  practice new skills and deepen my knowledge. Soon after, I
	  discovered Khan Academy, an online learning website
	  committed to providing a "world class education for anyone
	  anywhere" ("Khan Academy"). I used Salman Khan's online
	  lessons to help get through difficult concepts in calculus
	  and chemistry; I loved how I could replay the lessons if I
	  did not understand them the first time. After seeing Khan
	  featured on "60 Minutes," I read his book, The One World
	  Schoolhouse. Reading his book I recognized that my
	  education, like most students' education, is full of
	  holes. Whether it is because of personal stress, lack of
	  motivation, immaturity or a simple sick day, most students
	  struggle to create the best foundation on which to build
	  their growing knowledge. Salman Khan argues that web-based
	  learning has the potential to correct this problem. Filling
	  in some conceptual gaps for me, a student enrolled in one of
	  the best school districts in the United States, might help
	  me have a more successful high school or college
	  career. More significant, however, is considering the
	  possibility for helping students in underserved school
	  districts lacking resources for identifying and assisting
	  when one has fallen behind. In underserved school districts,
	  falling behind might mean the difference between graduating
	  and going on to college or lifelong struggles against
	  poverty. This discovery has led me to believe in the
	  potential for online, self-paced and self-directed learning
	  to transform education in our country where top-notch
	  Deerfield High School is an anomalous bastion of opportunity
	  rather than the standard for American students.

          My goal in this project is to present my research in
          the form of this website I have developed completely
          through online learning resources. In doing so, I have
          educated myself in a self-paced and self-directed way
          on how to build a website. Doing so combines my
          passion for computer programming with my interest in
          the promise of technology in education reform. The
          website itself displays my research and findings as
          well as offers links to online learning resources. I
          also hope to promote the idea that education needs to
          adapt in this age of information. I believe that my
          generation has a mandate to embrace the technology
          available to reform learning and formal education to
          promote equality of educational opportunity because it
          goes hand in hand with the opportunity for prosperity.
