	<h4>Conclusion</h4>
	<p>
	  The answer to the driving question of my research into the
	  potential for online learning technology to promote
	  educational opportunity, which goes hand in hand with the
	  promise of prosperity, is a resounding yes. Resources
	  currently available have the capability to improve the
	  quality of and accessibility to education not just in
	  America, but also in the world. Whether or not educators are
	  ready for it, it will transform the American education
	  system; how quickly this will happen depends in part on how
	  loudly Americans demand change. Educational opportunity
	  remains inextricably linked to economic prosperity and
	  quality of life, and it is doled out unequally in
	  America. Technology has the potential to change this by
	  offering online learning to any person with the desire to
	  learn, regardless of socioeconomic status, proximity to a
	  quality school, or the individual's pace and ability to
	  grasp concepts. While I appreciate the ways in which online
	  resources have augmented my own learning, the top-notch
	  education I received in Deerfield schools would have
	  prepared me for success even if I had never stumbled upon
	  resources such as Khan Academy. My hope is for technology to
	  reach students in America and beyond for whom access to
	  quality education is lacking. All students are equally
	  deserving of the opportunities I enjoy simply by living in
	  Deerfield; bringing online resources to American students to
	  enhance their educational experience is how I hope to see
	  our education system transform.
